Let's try this out for a spell. The ability to write anywhere is a good one, I think. What are the consequences of the trauma I've endured? What a great question. Why do I think it occurred?
I have a feeling that most of my feelings will be absent and this will be an exercise in factual statements. What do I think about it? That seems sort of simple. It was terrible, I'm a badass for coming through it, few have gone through situations as bad as what I have, I'd rather never talk about it with anyone, I'll continue down hat road some more.
What effect did these things have on my belief system? I'll have to think about that one. Did it strengthen or change it? Perception of myself others and the world, ...
How has it changed my thoughts about my own safety, how I trust people, how I view power and control, and intimacy. Can I get close to people? Physically or otherwise?
