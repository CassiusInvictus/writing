no ability to do something analogous to iMessage, even though I own a w10 phone and a w10 laptopp
device encryption - w10 phone doesn't include SD card?
device encryption - laptop include recovery key in onedrive? 
onedrive - invasive
edge - needs a bookmark manager/editor, instead of just the bookmarks toolbar
sync needs work, delays in syncing as well as artifacts that require a second delete
phone - size is great, speaker is great 
phone - OS is easy to use, actually intuitive. it's a great phone and a bad computer. it's also a bad camera.
edge - fast, smooth scrolling, great on system resources and battery life. good ui.
