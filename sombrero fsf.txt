Sombrero:
Dust swirled around my feet with each step I took.  My boots were old, too old; they'd have to last a while longer.  The blazing corona in the sky was an unavoidable fact.  The only sound was a soft wind hushing through the scrubs around coupled with my own steady breath.  I'd been on the rift for months and I was finally getting closer to him.
