There is no such luxury on single-person collection operations. Because of this, a deliberate approach to everything that you do is paramount. Nothing in the conduct of your mission should be unexpected, off the cuff, or “winged” in any sense. For this to happen, thorough mission planning and analysis with war-gaming needs to take place beforehand. Just as many professional athletes will internally visualize themselves successfully executing a complex physical movement before it takes place, so should you as the single collection operator (this is called Neural Drive). If, in your visualization of your mission, you encounter a stumbling point or part of the mission where something is foggy or hazy, stop what you’re doing, find the answer out for yourself, and start over. I could throw out a million different phrases here (Proper Prior Planning Prevents Piss Poor Performance comes to mind) but the bottom line is that we are all what we repeatedly do.

Know that goal, know where you fall within accomplishing that goal, know the other players on the team who are also working to accomplish that goal, and know every part of the performance, from mission receipt, planning, insert, movement to, actions on, and extract, and any possible contingencies that may arise.
