He was haunted by the many photos like this that he captured, and took his own life three months later. 
"I'm really, really sorry. The pain of life overrrides the joy to the point that joy does not exist...depressed, without phone...money for rent...money for child support...money!!!...I am haunted by the vivid memories of killings and corpses and anger and pain...of starving and wounded children, of trigger-happy madmen, often police, of killer executioners..."

"You know the answer as well as I do: you're doing something that they want you to stop. They fear what you do. They fear what we all do. So long as you keep doing it, you're winning. You don't need to go on a commando raid to beat them: you just need to keep doing what you're doing.

There's probably a million geezers out there who love Scot Colford films, but none of them can be arsed to make something fantastic out of them, the way you do. The fact, creativity is cheap, hard work is hard, and everyone wants to think his ideas are precious unique snowflakes, but ideas are like assholes, we've all got 'em.
