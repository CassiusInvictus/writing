Students stressed me out today, and I lost patience. It's hard for me to be excited or engaged when they aren't. I started a new game called Gone Home. You play a young woman who's just returned from a year in Europe. The house you come home to is empty, and you want to find out why. I read a few notes and journal entries from the main character's sister, and it's inspired me to write some more and re-journal again. I can't wait to get out of here and back to San Antonio. I really miss Phoebe and I am super horny.
