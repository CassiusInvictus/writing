biometrics should be treated as a login, not as a password
blackberry PRIV is incredibly secure, but still has to work with android's largest disadvantage - a largely uncontrolled application store
	but - FDE by default
	hard-installed VPN for all traffic through blackberry's servers
	patches shipped directly from blackberry to phones (like apple) - not dependent on cell carriers
	windows phone were the only unhackable devices at pwn2own

Write your story of joining the marine corps. Open standing at the door of the recruiting station, tell the other scenes in flashback. No more than 1200 words total. 

Telling other people what to do is my favorite thing in the world.

Cool thanks! 
Question. Any chance you can give me writing assignments? The pressure helps. 
You said this was the favorite part of your job... Haha. 
Thanks

Hey Chris--don't know if you saw this on the newsletter, but if you want to try reading some work to an audience, this is a super small nice start. Jessica and I and maybe one or two folks from here and belvoir plan to attend. Doesn't have to be poetry.

Dear Chris,

I owe you a big thanks for arranging everything for my visit to Walker Reed and Quantico. I found the trip both productive and rewarding. I especially appreciate how thoughtful you were about all the details.  

The student you mention below sounds like a great fit. I'm happy to work with you (and him) to set something up for him.  Let's chat next week.  Just an FYI that I'll be in California starting Wednesday and not back until the following Monday.

I hope you had a wonderful holiday with the family.

All the best,
Curtis

Congrats on the retirement. How do you like Baltimore? My wife is originally from south Maryland, and she loves Baltimore. I haven’t been yet but I know we’ll make a trip there in the future. What brought you there?
 
Things are going well for me. I’m in the process of starting an outdoor clothing company, Declaration Outfitters. I will have an online shop open mid-2015, and a website up in about a month. I’ll be heading to Shot show in January.
 
Any ideas on what you’re doing after retirement? I remember you were a great writer, are you still writing? I keep finding myself writing more and more, especially when I just recently realized that I actually enjoy it and it wasn’t just a random habit.
 
Good to hear from you!

Dear GySgt Buckminster,

I was happy we had a chance to talk, however briefly. I hope you will not hesitate
to call on me any time you think I can be helpful in the months (or years) ahead.

The program you and I discussed that will provide additional funding for your son's 
education is, again, VA Chapter 35.

I have copied below the link to the Transparent Language Programs that have been
made available to all wounded service members. Please let me know if you have
any difficulty setting up an account.

Best wishes always,

Heather
