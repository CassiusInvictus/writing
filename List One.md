List One.

On body: 
Keys - Contains keys for my truck, the housekey, my pen-drive, and my gold's gym membership card. Contained on a rectangular carabiner.

Wallet - Made of recycled rubber. Has four slots. Holds my Maine driver's license, retired ID, credit card, check card, and a bunch of Shell gas cards.

Phone - Right now, I have two: My blue Nokia cricket phone, and my Sony Xperia Z3 from T-Mobile.

Knife - A Kershaw speed-folder. Got it in OTC. Well-used and well-loved.

Backpack - A green battered REI Outlook 40 with numerous scratches, scrapes, black soot, and a rip or two. I've had this thing with me everywhere. There is a "Warfighter Sports" patch on the front of it that is both sewed and glued.

Watch - Casio G-Shock Mudman. All black with red numbers. Digital. Very tough.

KIA Bracelet - I'm very ambivalent about this. Sometimes I really want to wear it, and other times I don't want to wear it at all.

What's usually in my backpack:

Nalgene, two - Old and beat-up, with a "Mountain Professionals" sticker on it. The other is covered in stickers.

Pens, two - One is a blue Pilot V5 (very fine point). The other is an orange "Seven year pen" with a blue dacshshund on the side.

Headphones - I forget the brand, but the company is owned by Bob Marley's son. There's a black, brown, and green sheath that covers the headphone cord, and the headphones themselves are black earbuds with a gold attachment. They have a good lower-end feel to them.

Camera - This changes. My Sony phone has a pretty decent camera. Sometimes I carry an IPod touch with an 8MP camera. I also have a Fujifilm Instax Mini 90. I'm in the market for a cheap, used DSLR but that's low priority.

Buff - It's orange paisley. I use my Buff for a lot of different things, but right now it's primary purpose is to act as a cover for my Ipad. It does this well.

Notebook - Medium-sized Moleskine. I like to have physical paper on me, so I don't rely on technology all of the time.

Ipad - A brand new IPad Air 2. I received it for free from the Semper Fi Fund. Awesome stuff.

Bluetooth Keyboard w/ built-in stand - Made by logitech. It's full-sized, the keys feel great when you type. Connects via bluetooth. It was 30 bucks and it's by far my favorite typing instrument.
