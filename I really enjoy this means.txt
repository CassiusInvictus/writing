I really enjoy this means of writing, more than anything else I've used so far. I love my Macbook Air, but it's just a little too small. And my big laptop is great for gaming but the keyboard is...squishy. This ipad air 2, though. I love the full-size bluetooth keyboard. The screen is bright and large. I can move the keyboard around. There's no delay between typing and it showing up on the screen. It just feels more productive. 
How do I feel about getting out? Well, aside figuring out how to cement my disability ratings, I'm really excited. I'm enthusiastic about the future. Already, I feel myself more inclined to write. I'm eager to explore this world, learn, and be unlimited in my freedom of choice. And in terms of defining myself- figuring out what it means to me to be a combat veteran, and how I'll present myself to the world, and to other vets. Especially as a vet with a diagnosis of severe PTSD, TBI, and extensive combat experience. I want to gently educate the interested public. 
What do I want to do? I want to explore. I want to get to know an area well. I want to never have to give up this new-found flexibility and freedom. I want to write my ass off and improve my craft (because that's what writing is to me, it is my craft). Road trips. I want to really see America for the first time. I've spent ten years of my life offering up my whole self for the advancement of America's foreign policy, and I think it's high time I got to know the country I swear allegiance to. 



Maybe I just need to get over myself.
